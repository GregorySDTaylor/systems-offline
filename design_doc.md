Basic Concept:
	A shmup. Ship has 3 abilities: attack, shield, and drive. These are all passive abilities that can be toggled on and off using the A, S, and D buttons respectively. Active abilities deplete the energy bar of the corresponding color (red, blue, and green respectively). Bullets of a certain color will deplete the energy bar of the corresponding color, unless that ability is toggled off. Toggling off an ability recharges its energy bar as well as powering up the other abilities that are toggled on. If all three energy bars become completely depleted, the player dies.

Attack
level 1 (all abilities on):
level 2 (one other ability off):
level 3 (both other abilities off):

Shield
level 1 (all abilities on):
Red and Green bullets deplete the Blue energy bar instead of the Red and Green energy bars. Blue bullets completely deplete the blue energy bar. Does not deplete over time.
level 2 (one other ability off):
All properties from level 1. Additionally, bullets will recharge the energy bar of the corresponding color if that ability is toggled off.
level 3 (both other abilities off:
All properties from level 2. Additionally, enemies that come into contact with the player's shield are destroyed.

Drive
level 1 (all abilities on):
	
level 2 (one other ability off):
level 3 (both other abilities off:
